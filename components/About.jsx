            I'm Levi John Favour, a versatile web developer with a deep toolkit of skills. From
            ReactJS and NextJS to Tailwind CSS, Material UI, and Bootstrap CSS, I've navigated them
            all during my 2.5+ years in the coding world.

            With a National Diploma in Computer Sciences and a track record of success, I've honed
            my craft through meaningful experiences. I proudly contributed as a Front-End Developer
            for the USAF (United States of Africa) for 7 months, playing a role in remarkable
            projects. I also gained valuable insights during my Front-End Developer internship at
            Saultech Nigeria.

            What sets me apart? My ability to swiftly grasp new concepts, coupled with my
            collaborative spirit. While I excel at individual work, I thrive in team settings,
            learning from fellow professionals. Versatility is my strength â€“ throw any challenge my
            way, and I'll meet it head-on. Let's build something remarkable together.
